▣ Parallelogram

	• Properties - The opposite sides are parallel and congruent.
				 - The opposite angles are congruent.
				 - The consecutive angles are supplementary.
				 - If any one of the angles is a right angle, then all the other angles will be at right angle.
				 - The two diagonals bisect each other.
				 - Each diagonal bisects the parallelogram into two congruent triangles.
				 - The Sum of square of all the sides of parallelogram is equal to the sum of square of its diagonals.

	• Area 		= base * hight
				= side * base * sin(any angle between the sides)
				= ((diagonal_1 * diagonal_2) / 2) * sin(any angle between at the intersection point of the diagonals)
	• Perimeter = 2 * (side + base)



▣ Triangle

	• Properties - The sum of all the angles of a triangle (of all types) is equal to 180°.
				 - The sum of the length of the two sides of a triangle is greater than the length of the third side.
				 - In the same way, the difference between the two sides of a triangle is less than the length of the third side.
				 - If any one of the angles is a right angle, then all the other angles will be at right angle.
				 - The side opposite the greater angle is the longest side of all the three sides of a triangle.
				 - The exterior angle of a triangle is always equal to the sum of the interior opposite angles.
				 - Two triangles are said to be similar if their corresponding angles of both triangles are congruent and the lengths of their sides are proportional.

	• Area 				= (base * hight) / 2
						= sqrt(s * (s – a) * (s – b) * (s – c))
	• Perimeter 		= a + b + c
	• Semi-perimeter, s = (a + b + c) / 2

▣ Degenerate Triangle

	• Properties - The area of a degenerate triangle is equal to zero.

				 - The diameter of a circle is the longest chord of a circle.
				 - Equal chords of a circle subtend equal angles at the centre.
				 - The radius drawn perpendicular to the chord bisects the chord.
				 - Circles having different radius are similar.

	• Area 			= pi * r * r
	• Diameter 		= 2 * r
	• Circumference = 2 * pi * r
