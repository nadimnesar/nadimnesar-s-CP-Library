# nadimnesar's Competitive Programming Library

## Overview
Welcome to my personal coding library! This library contains a collection of algorithms, data structures, and utility functions that I've developed and curated over time to aid me in solving competitive programming problems.

## Contents
This library includes implementations of various algorithms, data structures, and utilities commonly used in competitive programming.

## Usage
Feel free to explore the library and use any components that may be helpful in your own competitive programming journey. Each file is thoroughly documented with explanations and usage examples to aid understanding and usage.

## Contribution
While most of the code in this library has been personally developed by me, there might be instances where I've modified existing implementations found elsewhere to suit my needs. If you spot any issues, have suggestions for improvements, or would like to contribute new algorithms or data structures, please feel free to submit a pull request. Contributions are highly appreciated!

## License
This library is provided under the [MIT License](LICENSE), which means you are free to use, modify, and distribute the code for both personal and commercial purposes. However, I would appreciate it if you could include a reference to this repository if you decide to use any part of this library in your own projects.
