# nadimnesar's Competitive Programming Library

## Overview
Welcome to my personal coding library! This library contains a collection of algorithms, data structures, and utility functions that I've developed and curated over time to aid me in solving competitive programming problems.

## Contents
This library includes implementations of various algorithms, data structures, and utilities commonly used in competitive programming. The contents are organized into different categories for easy navigation:

### Algorithms
- **Backtracking**: Implementations of backtracking algorithms.
- **Mo's Algorithm**: Implementation of Mo's algorithm for range queries.
- **Segment Tree**: Implementation of the segment tree data structure.
- **Sparse Table**: Implementation of the sparse table data structure for range queries.
- **Trie**: Implementation of the trie data structure for efficient string manipulation.

### Dynamic Programming
- **0/1 Knapsack**: Implementation of the 0/1 knapsack problem.
- **Edit Distance**: Implementation of the edit distance algorithm.
- **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)**: Implementation of the longest common subsequence algorithm.
- **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)**: Implementation of the longest increasing subsequence algorithm.

### Graph Algorithms
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Implementation of the BFS algorithm.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for single-source shortest paths.

### Number Theory
- Various number theory algorithms and functions.

### Search & Sorting Algorithms
- Various searching and sorting algorithms.

### Bit Manipulation
- Various bitwise operations.

### Hashing
- **Single Hashing**: Implementation of single hashing.
- **Double Hashing**: Implementation of double hashing.
- **Backward Hashing**: Implementation of backward hashing.
- **Hashing + Segment Tree**: Combination of hashing and segment tree.

### Utilities
- **Sublime Build Environment for C++ in Windows and Linux**: Setup instructions for configuring a Sublime Text build environment for C++.
- **Test Case Generator**: Utility for generating test cases.

## Usage
Feel free to explore the library and use any components that may be helpful in your own competitive programming journey. Each file is thoroughly documented with explanations and usage examples to aid understanding and usage.

## Contribution
While most of the code in this library has been personally developed by me, there might be instances where I've modified existing implementations found elsewhere to suit my needs. If you spot any issues, have suggestions for improvements, or would like to contribute new algorithms or data structures, please feel free to submit a pull request. Contributions are highly appreciated!
